Abstract: How can we leverage news data for economic forecasting? In this study, I analyze a large collection of news articles from Peru spanning from 2012 to 2020. Through a combination of topic modeling and sentiment analysis, I transform these articles into monthly variables reflecting fluctuations in economic themes and changes in news tone over time. Identified topics include business and market dynamics, infrastructure development and investment, and the pandemic. I develop prediction models that integrate these variables with traditional predictors to forecast GDP growth rate and unemployment rate. The GDP prediction model achieves a match rate of 88\%, accurately predicting the direction of economic activity in approximately 9 out of 10 instances. While early 2020 models struggle to fully capture the extent of the downturn in March, subsequent models produce predictions that closely align with actual values. Key predictors include sentiment variables, coverage of COVID-related news, electricity usage indicators, and firms’ expectations regarding future demand levels, as well as their perceptions of sales, prices, and inventories compared to the previous month. For unemployment rate prediction, the optimal model incorporates lagged features and also achieves a match rate of 87\%. Models for the pre-COVID period also capture directional changes, but they exhibit reduced efficacy in fully representing fluctuation magnitudes. This indicates that the model’s strong performance for the full period may stem from the shock, revealing weaker predictive ability in typical months.
