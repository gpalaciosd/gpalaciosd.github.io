Abstract: In this study, I explore the factors influencing teacher retention in schools in Peru, where candidates for permanent positions go through a standardized evaluation and school-level screenings. These evaluations, combined with candidates’ preferences, determine school assignments. Using variance decomposition analysis, I find location characteristics as the most influential factor, followed by school characteristics, teacher attributes, matching considerations, and rurality bonuses. Location is especially important for permanent teachers, who value district and school location characteristics, low vulnerability to hazards, and proximity to their residence. Teacher attributes, including prior experience in the public sector, also influence retention, with those possessing less experience being more prone to leaving. Matching variables also play a role; schools are more likely to retain teachers
when they align with teachers’ preferences or vice versa. I then further investigate matching effects using school fixed effects and instrumental variables models. Results from the former indicate that schools hiring their top-choice candidates are between 2 to 4 percentage points more likely to retain permanent teachers over time compared to those hiring less preferred candidates. However, the instrumental variables approach produce positive effects that are not statistically significant. These findings suggest a small positive matching effect, but further exploration is required to assess significance. From a policy perspective, it becomes important to design a matching system that leverages the benefits of quality matches without compromising quantity.
