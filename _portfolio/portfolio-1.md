Abstract: Public schools around the world face teacher shortages, especially in rural areas. This paper asks whether temporary exposure to the public sector impacts a teacherâ€™s pathway to becoming a permanent teacher. I study exposure effects in Peru, where candidates for temporary positions take a standardized evaluation and then select schools sequentially based on their score. I use administrative data on teacher evaluation performance, school preferences, and public sector trajectory, to estimate differences in employment outcomes between temporary teachers and external candidates. Temporary teachers are one percentage point (p.p.) more likely to secure a permanent position in the next competition, constituting a 55 percent increase compared to the mean hiring probability of 1.8 p.p. for external candidates. Effects are larger for more competitive candidates, who report a 6.8p.p. increase (56 percent rise) in their hiring probability. I find evidence that an increased interest in the public sector and changes in preferences drive these effects. Temps are 11.6 p.p. more likely to enroll in the next competition, and they participate more at every stage. In the future, temps in rural schools are more likely to include rural schools in their preferred choices, and to attend interviews and secure a permanent position there. Lastly, the largest effects are observed among inexperienced teachers, who exhibit a 2.7 p.p. increase in their hiring probability. This suggests that giving inexperienced teachers a foot in the door may level the field and have long-lasting effects.
