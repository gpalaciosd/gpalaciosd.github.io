I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, specializing in labor economics and data science. My research focuses on strategies to attract and retain high-quality teachers in public education and the application of machine learning for nowcasting macroeconomic variables. My primary interest lies in integrating econometric and machine learning techniques to enhance causal inference and prediction in policy discussions.

This summer, I will join the Menlo Park office of Analysis Group as an Associate, applying my expertise in economics and data science. Last summer, as a Summer Associate at Analysis Group, I contributed to litigation research and strategy by applying economic and statistical tools. I also served as an External Consultant for the World Bank's Macroeconomics, Trade, and Investment Practice in the Africa Region and for the Inter-American Development Bank’s Department of Research and Chief Economist.

Before my Ph.D., I was a Research Fellow at Evidence for Policy Design (EPoD) at Harvard, analyzing data from randomized controlled trials and administrative sources to evaluate tax and vocational training policies in Pakistan. This work informed discussions on innovative approaches to incentivize tax collection and vocational training uptake. Additionally, I spent over a year as an Economic Specialist at the Central Reserve Bank of Peru. I hold a Master's in Economics from the University of British Columbia and a Bachelor’s in Economics from Universidad de Piura.

In my spare time, I enjoy biking, reading sci-fi stories, and singing along to pop music. Recently, I’ve been learning piano and love attempting to play my favorite songs.
