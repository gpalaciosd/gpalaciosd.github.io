I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, specializing in labor economics and data science. My research focuses on two main areas: strategies to attract and retain high-quality teachers in the public education system, and the application of machine learning tools for nowcasting macroeconomic variables. My primary interest lies in integrating econometric and machine learning techniques to enhance causal inference and prediction in policy discussions.

Throughout my Ph.D., I've gained experience in both the private sector and international development organizations. Last summer, I worked as a Summer Associate for Analysis Group in Menlo Park, where I contributed to research, analysis, and strategy in litigation cases by applying economic and statistical tools. Previously, I served as an External Consultant for the Macroeconomics, Trade, and Investment Practice in the Africa Region at the World Bank. In this role, I developed models to assess the efficiency of public expenditure in Nigeria and examined the country’s labor market as part of the growth diagnostic section of the 2020 Nigeria Country Economic Memorandum. Additionally, I worked as an External Consultant for the Department of Research and Chief Economist at the Inter-American Development Bank, using police detention data and econometric models to investigate the behavior of law enforcement agencies in Chile.

Prior to my Ph.D., I was a Research Fellow at Evidence for Policy Design (EPoD), a research center at Harvard. There, I analyzed data from randomized controlled trials and administrative sources to evaluate the impact of tax and vocational training policies in Pakistan. I also helped design and implement an experiment on market linkages for small entrepreneurs. This research contributed to discussions and papers on innovative approaches to incentivize tax collection and promote the take-up of vocational training.

My professional experience also includes over a year as an Economic Specialist for the Department of Economic Indicators at the Central Reserve Bank of Peru. I hold a Master's in Economics from the University of British Columbia (UBC) and a Bachelor’s in Economics from Universidad de Piura.

This summer, I will be joining the Menlo Park office of Analysis Group as an Associate, further applying my expertise in economics and applied data science.

In my spare time, I enjoy biking, reading sci-fi stories, and listening to and singing along with pop music. Recently, I’ve been learning piano and love attempting to play my favorite songs.
